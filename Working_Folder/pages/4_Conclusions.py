    It can be discerned from our analysis, that out of the three metrics used in our project there are two that stick out in particular...

    **Points Per Game:**

    This metric is severly over valued in the current market. Top shooters in the league currently are underperforming their current salaries by
    an average of around $60,000 dollars and the other two metrics (Assists and Rebounds per Game) do not come close to hitting that mark.

    **Rebounds Per Game:**

    This metric was astounding to see have the effect that is does, especially since is has not actual weighted scale when it comes to fantasy grading
    of players Not only was the average performance of players according to their salaries right around the break even line (over by $13,000), 
    the bigger contracts have predictable outcoems as almost all of them are massively underperforming in the current season so far!
