# NBA-Most-Valuable-Player-By-The-Numbers https://nbatriplemetricsalaryevaluation.streamlit.app/
**Introduction:**

This is a personal research project to find the value of NBA players in the regular season according to their contracts.

To be more specific, in this project, we look at three metrics (Points Per Game, Assists Per Game, and Rebounds Per Game) and determine the value of these metrics in the evaluation of current NBA player's salaries.

I am curious to see what of these three vital metrics to the game of basketball inflate or are a good indicator of the value of a player on a team.

**Data/operation abstraction design:**
I retrieved my data from sports-reference.com and prepared it by filtering top players from these three metrics as well as the top earners in the league.

**Future work:**
Future work I would like to do on this app includes seeing how well individual teams have managed the money line for their player contracts according to these metrics, as well as which position in the game has the most inflated salary and the most break-even salary compared to other positions!
