# NBA-Most-Valuable-Player-By-The-Numbers
This is a personal research project to find the value of NBA players in the regular season according to their contracts.

To be more specific, in this project, we look at three metrics (Points Per Game, Assists Per Game, and Rebounds Per Game) and determine the value of these metrics in the evaluation of current NBA player's salaries.
